# CGQ1 FE solve for the Poisson equation
This is a Poisson equation solver by CGQ1 finite element method on uniform rectangular meshes and implemented in python with only NumPy and SciPy packages.

By CGQ1 finite element method, the degrees of freedom is 4*(Number of elements). 
The unit square domain has the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.
